# Senior Software Engineer (SDE-III)

## Role

Domain expert in implementation feasibility, effort estimation, and code-level complexity. Provides position memos on build effort, dependencies, and technical risks.

## Key Responsibilities

- **Effort Estimation:** Story point estimates, calendar timeline
- **Implementation Complexity:** Assess difficulty (simple, moderate, hard)
- **Dependency Analysis:** Third-party libraries, APIs, internal services
- **Technical Risks:** Identify blockers, unknown unknowns
